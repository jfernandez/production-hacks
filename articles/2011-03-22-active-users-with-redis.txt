title: Active Users with Redis
date: 22/03/2011

Want to log and display the active users in your web application? Enjoy using [Redis](http://redis.io)? Read on.~

Scenario
--------

A user with ID <span style="color:green">123</span> hits our web application.  The unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) for the current date and time is: <span style="color:blue">1300803419</span>.

Logging
-------

We insert the user’s ID as a member of the <span style="color:#FF6600">'active-users'</span> Sorted Set, using the timestamp as the score.

**ZADD** <span style="color:#FF6600">'active-users'</span> <span style="color:blue">1300803419</span> <span style="color:green">123</span>

If <span style="color:green">123</span> was already a member of the Sorted Set, Redis would **only update** the score to the new timestamp, effectively setting the user's last action timestamp.

Display
-------

If you want to display the active users in the last 15 minutes, you will first need to generate 2 timestamps.

`timestamp1` = 15 minutes ago

`timestamp2` = current date and time

Then return a range of members in the <span style="color:#FF6600">'active-users'</span> Sorted Set using these timestamps as the min and max scores.

`user_ids` = **ZRANGEBYSCORE** <span style="color:#FF6600">'active-users'</span> `timestamp1` `timestamp2`

The returned array will contain the user ID’s of all users active in the last 15 minutes.

That’s it.

What I like about this approach is that it’s simple and lightweight; only 1 entry in the Sorted Set per user.  You can also query “active users in the last X minutes/days/months” up to the date when you began logging the requests.
