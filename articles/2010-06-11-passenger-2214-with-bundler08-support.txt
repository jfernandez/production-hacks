title: Passenger 2.2.14 with bundler08 support
date: 11/06/2010

Passenger 2.2.14 now comes with built in Bundler support for Rails 3, but some Rails 2 apps might have explicitly added Bundler support in the "config/preinitializer.rb" file.

To stop Passenger from setting up Bundler (and crashing in the process), just create the "config/setup_load_paths.rb" file and copy your "config/preinitializer.rb" content in there.  Passenger will now detect the file and require it instead of running its Bundler setup.

Make sure to keep both files around too make the app backwards compatible with earlier versions of Passenger (for EY-Cloud support).
