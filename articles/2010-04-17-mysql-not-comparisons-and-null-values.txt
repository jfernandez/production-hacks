title: MySQL NOT Comparisons and NULL values
date: 17/04/2010

If you're using any of the MySQL NOT logical operators (NOT IN (?), <>, !=) on a column, you should be aware that all records that have a NULL column value will always be **excluded** by MySQL.

What if you do want to include the NULL value records? You could try something like this:

`SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id IS NULL OR author_id != 123`
